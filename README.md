# Deep Learning Foundation 
In this repository I will share the **source code** of all the projects of **[Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101)**.



## Core Curriculum:

#### 1- Neural Networks
Neural networks is the Bedrock to Deep learning . we'll learn how it works and test our ability by Building Neural Network from Sctratch.
**Keywords:** Logistic Regression ,Multilayer Perceptrons , Gradient Descent , Backpropagation.
