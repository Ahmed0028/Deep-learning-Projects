# Deep Learning Foundation 
In this repository I will share the **source code** of all the projects of **[Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101)**.



## Core Curriculum:

#### 1- Neural Networks
- **Summary:** Neural networks is the Bedrock to Deep learning . we'll learn how it works and test our ability by Building Neural Network from Sctratch.
- **Keywords:** Logistic Regression ,Multilayer Perceptrons , Gradient Descent , Backpropagation.

#### 2- Convolutional Neural Networks 
- **Summary:** Convolutional neural networks is the standrad for solving Computer Vision Problems. it's used in Self-Driving cars ,face recognation and Medical imaging . we'll learn how to build and train ConvNet using TensorFlow and using regularization technique like TensorFlow Dropout for reducing overfitting and apply that to image classification Problem.  
- **Keywords:** ConvNet,Tensorflow , Tensorflow Dropout , K Fold Cross Validation , Deep Neural Networks.

#### 3- Recurrent Neural Networks
- **Summary:** Recurrent Neural Networks are able to learn from sequences of data . in this section we'll learn the concept behind RNNs and a brief introduction to reinforcement learning to train an AI agent by giving it rewards for performing correct actions.  
- **Keywords:** RNNs,Hyperparameters,Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Word Embeddings,Word2Vec,TensorBoard.
