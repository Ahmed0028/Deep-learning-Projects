# Deep Learning Foundation 
In this repository I will share the source code of all the projects of **[Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101)**.



## Core Curriculum:

#### 1- Neural Networks
- **Summary:** Neural networks is the Bedrock to Deep learning . we'll learn how it works and test our ability by Building Neural Network from Sctratch.
- **Keywords:** Logistic Regression ,Multilayer Perceptrons , Gradient Descent , Backpropagation.

#### 2- Convolutional Neural Networks 
- **Summary:** Convolutional neural networks is the standrad for solving Computer Vision Problems. it's used in Self-Driving cars ,face recognation and Medical imaging . we'll learn how to build and train ConvNet using TensorFlow and using regularization technique like TensorFlow Dropout for reducing overfitting and apply that to image classification Problem.  
- **Keywords:** ConvNet,Tensorflow , Tensorflow Dropout , K Fold Cross Validation , Deep Neural Networks.

#### 3- Recurrent Neural Networks
- **Summary:** Recurrent Neural Networks are able to learn from sequences of data . RNNs also work great as feature extractors for text which you can use for things like sentiment analysis. Youâ€™ll use recurrent networks to generate new text and translate from one language to another. In this section we'll learn the concept behind RNNs and a brief introduction to reinforcement learning to train an AI agent by giving it rewards for performing correct actions.  
- **Keywords:** RNNs,Hyperparameters,Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Word Embeddings, Word2Vec,TensorBoard.

#### 4- Generative Adversarial Networks 
- **Summary:** Generative adversarial networks (GANS) pit two neural networks in competition, allowing these networks to model reality with amazing accuracy. Ian Goodfellow, the inventor of GANs, will show you how these fascinating models work and how to build them.
- **Keywords:** GANs.

## Projects :
#### [Project -1  Predict daily bike rental ridership](https://github.com/Ahmed0028/Deep-learning-Projects/tree/master/Project01-Predict%20daily%20bike%20rental%20ridership) 
- **Summary:** Build and train your own Neural Network from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day.




#### [Project -3 TV Script Generation](https://github.com/Ahmed0028/Deep-learning-Projects/tree/master/Project02-Image-classification) 
- **Summary:** Use deep learning to generate new scripts for your favorite TV show.

#### [Project -4 Language Translation](https://github.com/Ahmed0028/Deep-learning-Projects/tree/master/Project04-Language%20Translation) 
- **Summary:** Translate from one language to another.

#### [Project -5 Face Generation](https://github.com/Ahmed0028/Deep-learning-Projects/tree/master/Project05%20-Face%20Generation) 
- **Summary:** Compete two neural networks against each other to generate realistic faces.
